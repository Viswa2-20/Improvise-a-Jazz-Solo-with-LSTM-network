# Improvise-a-Jazz-Solo-with-LSTM-network
The Jazz Solo Improvisation project uses an LSTM neural network to generate jazz solos by predicting the next note in a sequence. While the core features are implemented, the project is still a work in progress, with minor refinements planned for the future.
