# Jazz Solo Improvisation with LSTM

## Overview

The **Jazz Solo Improvisation** project uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to generate jazz music by predicting the next note in a sequence. This system simulates how a jazz musician might improvise a solo, learning from MIDI datasets of jazz music. While the core model and functionality are implemented, the project is still in progress, with small improvements and refinements planned for the future.

## Features

- **Music Generation**: Generates jazz solos by predicting note sequences.
- **LSTM Network**: Utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory network for time-series data like music.
- **MIDI and Audio Output**: Converts generated music into MIDI and WAV formats.
- **Real-time Prediction**: Simulates live improvisation by generating notes dynamically.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
